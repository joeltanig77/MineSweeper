# MineSweeper

This is a classic implementation of the game MineSweeper! Instead of bombs, they are replaced with the classic/cursed Windows operating system! 

## How to run the program

On your terminal type this command in after you download the files:

```
python3 main.py
```
## Things to note 
This program also has features like: 
1. A move count
2. A timer that starts after each new game starts
3. Sounds that play as the player plays the game
4. A mute button that can be turned on if the user does not want any sounds to play while playing minesweeper
5. The ability for the player to flag bombs
